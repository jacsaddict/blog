Hi, I am jacsaddict, currently a student at Tsinghua University, who is currently in exchange at Osaka University. The main language used is python and Javascript. My interest is numerical analysis and node.js. Welcome to communicate.

This blog will be used to record learning things, as well as talks, etc., not just in the field of computer science.
